# Set

This project was originally created to give me a solitaire version of the pattern matching game Set (setgame.com) and as a way to practice and maintain my Android development skills after my first college internship. I really enjoyed the game, and at the time there either was no Android app available, or it was a non-trivial paid version, so I decided to make one.

I uploaded it to Github at least a year after I originally made it. A few years later when I returned to the project to revisit it, I found that the Android development environment had shifted to the point that this project would no longer build easily, so I decided to move on. It now lives as a relic of the efforts of a Math major with a summer of QA experience working in native Android development.
